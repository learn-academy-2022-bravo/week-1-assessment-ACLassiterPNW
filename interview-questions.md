# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
  Git is software that allows programming collaboration amongst different parties remotely, whereas Github is a centralized location where code can be accessed by said parties. 

  Researched answer: 
  Git is a version control system that helps programmers track changes in code and work together to complete a code base. GitHub is a hosting platform that allows for collaboration and version control. 


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
  The JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value are operators that compare values and give a true or false result. These would be lesser than/greater than/equal to operators, == and === operators, and yes or no operators. 

  Researched answer:
  As noted in our JavaScript Introduction material, the JavaScript operators that will return a Boolean value are logical operators and equality operators. 


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a value that exists at an assigned indexed position starting at 0 from left to right. Indexes allow programmers to access individual values or characters by their index number. A value is an item assigned to a variable, such as a word or number. 

  Researched answer:
  Values are chunks of data that are stored within their associated containers, known as variables. An index is the particular location of a value in an array, identified by sequential numbers. 



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  Iteration means carrying out a function a set number of times. 

  Researched answer:
  After reviewing our JavaScript Loops class material, I found that iteration is the process of performing an action a specific number of times or until a condition is met. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  In pair programming, the assigned roles are that of the navigator and driver. The driver is responsible for writing/typing out code in response to the navigator's directions. Along the way, both parties collaborate and talk through problems to find the best possible solution. The driver will share their code with the navigator in real time to provide visibility on progress or issues that arise. 

  Researched answer:
  Pair programming involves a driver and navigator. The driver uses their keyboard and mouse to manage the text editor, while the navigator watches, works through problems logically, and gives feedback to provide input and catch errors the driver may miss. Both parties will use the GitHub repo to contribute to the code base. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
A higher order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or outputs another function.

2. Jest:
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework comprised of files managed by a technology created by Facebook known as "yarn". Jest gives feedback in the form of fail/error messages which allows programmers to make changes as needed. 

3. Objects:
Objects are a type of data that contain collections of key:value pairs or functions, the latter combination known as methods. 

4. Method:
A method is a function assigned to an object. 

5. Classes:
Classes are reusable, changeable functions containing data and behavior. They are the templates for objects.
